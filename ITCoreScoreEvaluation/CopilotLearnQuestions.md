| Explain the use of the `$(document).ready()` function in jQuery.                                | It ensures the DOM is fully loaded before running the script.                                    |
| Describe how to add a CSS class to an element using jQuery.                                     | `$("#element").addClass("newClass");`                                                            |
| **Web Client UI Programming - Reactive Programming**                                                                |                                                                                                  |
| What is reactive programming?                                                                   | Reactive programming is an asynchronous programming paradigm focused on data streams and change propagation.|
| Explain the concept of observables in reactive programming.                                     | Observables represent data streams that can be observed for changes.                             |
| How do you create an observable in a reactive programming library (e.g., RxJS)?                 | `const observable = new Observable(subscriber => { subscriber.next(value); });`                  |
| Describe the use of the `subscribe` method in reactive programming.                             | `subscribe` is used to listen to and react to changes in the observable.                         |
| How do you handle errors in an observable stream?                                               | Use the `catchError` operator to catch and handle errors in the stream.                          |
